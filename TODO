### TODO:


#### bugs ####
# Correct naming of last build file - probably append an 'f' to the file name, that's all
# ***IMPORTANT*** SHOULD THE NUGGET STILL BE IN THE POST (THE I NEQ J PARTS, OBVIOUSLY) ??? NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND FIX
# sometimes get negative ISEs, is this plain wrong?


#### updates ####
# Is there a need for a separate final build function, or can this be combined into the training loop function somehow?
# Avoid doing inversion of A at all - this is very expensive. Instead solve Ax=y for x.


#### examples and tests ####
Provide meatier examples to run
