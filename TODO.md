# TODO

## major dev ideas
History matching - determine inputs from given outputs.
Provide loglikelihood options based on assumptions of priors (the MUCM and GP4ML use different loglikelihood functions)

## high priority -- BUGS

## medium priority -- helpful features
Option to plot the training points on the plots

## low priority -- small corrections


## documentation
explain the options for the optimisation a little better (stochastic is bounded so will always use constraints, and if stochastic is false then constaints option will choose to use a gradient optimiser as constrained or not)
