# TODO

## major dev ideas
History matching - determine inputs from given outputs.
Provide loglikelihood options based on assumptions of priors (the MUCM and GP4ML use different loglikelihood functions)

## high priority -- BUGS

## medium priority -- helpful features

Check that rational quadratic is correct (i.e. no deltas, only sigmas)

Why does GP4ML periodic kernel differ from the form in the Kernel Cookbook ??? Wiki is on side of GP4ML... more general to have the form in the kernel cookbok since we have another paramter?

## low priority -- small corrections
Option to plot the training points on the plots?

## documentation
add the climate example from GP4ML
