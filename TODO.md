## major dev
Allow MUCM nugget to be fitted as an independant hyperparameter?

Reinclude the MUCM method? (Sigma is a function of delta, rather than an independant fitting parameter...)

## bugs
code doesn't seem to work for 1D input anymore because of syntax like x[:,i] - could decide to not allow building from only one input, or should fix to allow a 1D-input emulator (which seems slightly pointless...)

## low priority
add nugget to the sensitivity analysis, since this is very simple

let the plotting options fixed_vals be specified in unscaled units?

## documentation
