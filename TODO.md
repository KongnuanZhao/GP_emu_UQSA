# TODO

## major dev ideas

## high priority -- BUGS

## medium priority -- helpful features
Find a faster optimised latin hypercube method, if possible - I could update my method to not store all the possible designs, and instead make one at a time, keeping the best one. Also, the distance matrix needs half the values I'm calculating, so I can change this to be less wastefull

Implement the llh-gradients for faster code

## low priority -- small corrections

## documentation
