# TODO

## major dev ideas

## high priority -- BUGS
the active_index might not be read in properly in reconstructed emulators: the code presumes an integer so can't handle lists?

## medium priority -- helpful features
mucm nugget should be maximally 1.0 and minimally 0.0

## low priority -- small corrections

## documentation
