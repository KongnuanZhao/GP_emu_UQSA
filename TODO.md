# TODO

## major dev ideas
History matching - determine inputs from given outputs.
Provide loglikelihood options based on assumptions of priors (the MUCM and GP4ML use different loglikelihood functions)

## high priority -- BUGS
Need to update the "create_emulator_files" function because it's now incorrect.

Code is finding answers for sigma outside of set bounds constraints...

## medium priority -- helpful features


## low priority -- small corrections


## documentation
