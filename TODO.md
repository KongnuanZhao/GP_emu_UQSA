# TODO

## major dev ideas
Get sensitivity working for a non-linear mean funtion

## high priority -- BUGS

## medium priority -- helpful features

## low priority -- small corrections
simplify emulatorclasses with dictionaries

allow 2D plots to plot the points too, by colouring the scatter points by output value

provide better error capture on misused plot function

## documentation
Add example for History Matching routines (include an example of how to run in parallel)

Mean functions must use numpy sytax e.g. np.cos(x)
