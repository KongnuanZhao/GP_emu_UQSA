# TODO

## major dev ideas
History matching - determine inputs from given outputs.
Provide MUCM case 2 sensitivity routines.

## high priority -- BUGS
Need to check that the mean function is being used correctly so that a zero mean can be set correctly (it may all already be fine)

Do the sensitivity routines work in unscaled inputs?

## medium priority -- helpful features
Need to be able to fix certain hyperparameters so that we don't attempt to fit these at all


## low priority -- small corrections


## documentation
add the climate example from GP4ML
