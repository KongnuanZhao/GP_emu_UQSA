# TODO

## major dev ideas

## high priority -- BUGS
Need to determine if deterministic sigma can be used in case of fittin the nugget, so I should test this by doing a full fit too.

## medium priority -- helpful features
Option to either predict mean (inc nugget in K**) or predict observation (nugget not in K**)

If not PSD, maybe try the next initial guess until we've exhausted the guesses.

## low priority -- small corrections

## documentation
add the climate example from GP4ML
