# TODO

## major dev ideas
Provide a function to easily produce a posterior given a set of test points

Get sensitivity working for a non-linear mean funtion

## high priority -- BUGS
Is active_index output correctly so the HM routines can read it in?

## medium priority -- helpful features
mucm nugget should be maximally 1.0 and minimally 0.0

Perhaps include option to fix certain inputs values for HM routine?

## low priority -- small corrections
Give better output for current calculations in sensitivity functions

## documentation
Write docs for history matching routines

History Matching imp() has new argument for which inputs to look at
