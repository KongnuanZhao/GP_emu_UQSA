# TODO

## major dev ideas
Get sensitivity working for a non-linear mean funtion

Redesign history matching based on conversation with Ian Vernon

## high priority -- BUGS
Check the diagonal correction in the gradient of loglikelihood_gp4ml function

In noise_fit(), zp_outputs is only made properly when datasize is divisible by the number of sets - I should generalize this

## medium priority -- helpful features

## low priority -- small corrections

## documentation
Add example for History Matching routines (include an example of how to run in parallel)

Update docs for optimalLatinHyperCube() function
